## Past Changelog
This is the changelog before this was published to GitHub. Further changes will be added to commits.

### V4.1
- Due to the creator of the official Fortnite Soundpack discontinuing updates, further changes may become slower and less frequent.
- In this most likely final version, the pack has been upgraded to Season 12.
- The soundpack has now been modified a bit to support Swamp's newest sounds folder structure.
- Some of the sounds, especially in the weapons, music and players section, have either been modified, switched around, or changed completely.
- Additional sounds have been included in the player, items, and steps sections, and some additional music tracks have been added for Crash and Map6.
- This update also removes folders that Swamp no longer rlies upon, such as the Get subfolder under the items folder. Not only that, but it also removes unnecessary files and folders that made the pack bigger than it needed to be. Although this was addressed in 4.0, it was not really done completely. This means from now on, you are responsible for your old Swamp sounds, so keep them handy in case you want to revert back to the original sounds!

### V4.01
- Adds some extra weapons. 
- Corrects AR15 sounds.
- Corrects readme.

### V4.0
- Upgrades pack to Season X (10). 
- In 4.01, the longbow and chainsaw will be back, so keep using Captain America's shield and Hawkeye's bow while you can!
- Removes folders that the pack doesn't use, decreasing the soundpack size by 500+MB. This ensures the pack stays as small as possible. This also means you'll need to have the Swamp sounds in the first place.
- Reverts all music to Fortnite's music packs. I did have to reuse a few, like Map1 is also Warehouse 1, but it'll do.
- Changes Menu Music to something more recent.
- Renames package to FNSSP, short for FortniteSwampSoundpack.
- Updates readme to include more instructions.

### V3.01
- Fixes get sounds. 
### V3.0
- This update is rather small, but we're now in Season 9, so we'll call it 3.0 anyway! Here are your changes.
- Bring out Captain America on the zombies by using his shield, which is the chainsaw. I couldn't find any other good weapons to put it on, since the riot shield is just garbage, but hey! If you want it on the riot shield, let me know!
- Bring out Hawkeye by using the longbow, finish the zombies off with this thing!
- Adds some new cool tracks to the Music folder.
- Adds a credits file.
- And yup, that's about it in this update!

### V2.02
- Adds a mini-gun to the weapons list, let me know how it functions!
- Fixes the AR fire sounds, they have been officially switched to the new sounds. Sorry about the mislead in 2.0.
### V2.01
- This is just a tiny update that addresses the ScarH' draw and reload sounds, which have been fixed.
### V2.0
- Upgrades pack to Season 8, changing several sounds from the soundpack which was Season 6.
- Introduces the new AR sounds to the soundpack.
- Changes warehouse music to some epic Fortnite tracks.
- Fixed volume on AR reload sounds, and decreased volume by half on the Tactical shotgun.
- Stereo files, especially FireM.wav in each weapon folder, are now mono like they are supposed to be.
- Creates burst files for the AR15 and AK47, they were previously just the default Swamp burst sounds. Also changes burst for the ScarH.
- Fixes reloading sounds for several modified weapons, including the AK47 and Desert Eagle.
### V1.1
- Switches over to GoldWave as audio editing software for the pack rather than Audacity.
- Adds some new weapons like the Revolver and the Desert Eagle, as well as the regular default pistol. Check the readme for exact weapon assignments.
- Switches over to Fortnite UI sounds for the menus, as well as the intro music.
- Slightly modifies step sounds like wood and water to Fortnite's version of those sounds.
### V1.0
- Starts the soundpack on Season 6, adjusting several sounds and getting weapons and other sounds in their placements.
